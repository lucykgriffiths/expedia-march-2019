# Culpeper Community Garden

## About

We've been working for Culpeper Community Garden by giving their website a much needed refresh. 
Culpeper is a shared space among the community for those who do not have gardens of their own, 
and is run by both volunteers and its own members.

Here are some questions to help you get going...

- What/who is it for?
Culpeper Community Garden

- What problem is it trying to solve?
Culpeper is dependent on donations and fund-raising, 
so having a good website is essential to getting the much-needed resource.

- What inspired you?
We are all inspired by the work that Culpeper does in the local community. All of the charity
representatives are passionate about their work and driving to make Culpeper a success.

- How did you come up with the idea?
Culpeper already had a website hosted on Wordpress that they wanted updating. We worked together with
the charity to think of some implementable requirements that would hopefully increase the number of 
online donations.
